# Furry Game

Furry Game was created during the bootcamp (CodersLab).
The main purpose of this workshop was to build a game using object-oriented JavaScript and 
starting using Webpack.

Basic rule is to catch as many coins as it is possible.
The coins are showing up randomly on the board.
To move Furry use your arrows keys: up(up arrow), down( down arrow), left( left arrow), right(right arrow).
The game ends when you hit the wall.

# Enjoy your game!
